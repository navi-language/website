## Introduction

Navi (/ˈnævi/) is a high-performance programming and stream computing language developed in Rust, originally designed for complex and high-performance computing tasks. It is also suited as a glue language embedded within heterogeneous services in financial systems.

In addition to its capabilities as a statically typed, compiled language, Navi offers the convenience of script-like execution. It can compile source code into Bytecode (without JIT) or Machine Code (with JIT), providing a flexible development workflow. Theoretically, Navi delivers competitive performance on par with Go, Rust, and C.

### Language Design Philosophy

- **Simple and Clean Syntax**

  Designed with a straightforward and clean syntax.

- **Modern Optional-Type and Error-Handling Design**

  With a modern design of optional types and error handling, Navi allows developers to gracefully manage exceptional cases and abnormal data.

- **No NULL Pointer Panic, Safe Runtime**

  No NULL pointer exceptions. Once your code compiles, you can expect consistent and reliable execution.

- **Scripted or Compiled Execution**

  Supports script-like execution, but offers the same performance comparable to compiled languages like Go.

### Functionalities

- **Dual-Domain Programming**

  Serves as a dual-purpose language, functioning as both a general-purpose programming language and a domain-specific language optimized for incremental computation.

- **High Performance**

  As a statically typed, compiled language, which is comparable to Go, Rust, and C.

- **Cross-platform**

  Running on Linux, Windows, macOS, and through WebAssembly (WASM), it extends its reach to iOS, Android, and Web Browsers.

- **Native Cloud Support (WIP)**

  With its standard library, Navi enables seamless manipulation of cloud computing resources as if they were local.

- **Native Financial Support (WIP)**

  Navi is equipped with native support for incremental financial data computation, making it ideal for real-time calculation and analysis of stock market data.
  It boasts a rich set of scientific computing capabilities, including built-in functions for technical stock market indicators, and standard library support for
  LongPort OpenAPI, significantly reducing development costs for programmatic trading.

## Standard Library

The [Navi Standard Library](/stdlib/) has its own documentation.

## Getting Started

Write a `main.nv`, `.nv` is the file extension of the Navi language.

```nv
use std.io;

fn main() throws {
    let name = "World";
    let message = `Hello ${name}!\n`;
    io.println(message);
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi run
Hello World!
```

> NOTE: If the file name is `main.nv` and it has the `main` function. The `navi run` will use it as the program entry.
> You also can execute with `navi run main.nv`.

This code sample demonstrates the basic syntax of Navi.

- The `use` keyword is used to import the `io` module from the standard library.
- The `//` is used to comment a line.
- The `fn` keyword is used to define a function.
- The `main` function is the entry point of the program, the `main` function must have the `throws` keyword, and it can throw an error.
- The `throws` keyword is used to declare a function that can throw an error.
- The `let` keyword is used to declare a variable.
- The `name` variable is a string type, or you can use `let name: string = "World";` to declare it.
- The `message` variable is defined by a string interpolation (Like JavaScript) by using "``", and the `${name}` is a variable reference.
- The `io.println` function is used to print a string to the console.
- Use `;` to end a statement.
- Finally, the Code style uses 4 spaces for indentation.\

## Comments

Navi supports 2 types of comments (Like Rust).

The `//` started is a normal comment, and it will be ignored by the compiler.

For example:

```nv,no_run
// This is a normal comment.
fn say(name: string): string {
    // This is a normal comment.
    // This is the second line of normal comment.
    return `Hello ${name}!`;
}
```

There is no multi-line comment in Navi. If you want to write a multi-line comment, just use `//` for each line.

## Doc Comments

A doc comment is started with `///`, and it will be parsed by the compiler and generate documentation. You can write Markdown in it.

For example:

````nv,no_run
/// A struct doc comment.
struct User {
    /// The user's name.
    name: string,
}

impl User {
  /// This is a doc comment for a function.
  ///
  /// ## Args
  ///
  /// - name: The name of the person to say hello to.
  ///
  /// ```nv
  /// let user = User { name: "Navi" };
  /// assert_eq user.say(), "Hello Navi!";
  /// ```
  fn say(self): string {
      return `Hello ${self.name}!`;
  }
}
````

### Doctest

You can write Markdown Code Block in your doc comment, and use `navi test --doc` to run the doc tests.

Like regular tests, doc tests use the `assert`, `assert_eq`, and `assert_ne` keywords for assertion.

For example:

````nv,no_run
/// This is a doc comment for a function.
///
/// ```nv
/// let s = say("World");
/// assert_eq s, "Hello";
/// ```
fn say(name: string): string {
    return `Hello ${name}!`;
}
````

Then you can run `navi test --doc` to run the doc test.

```shell
$ navi test --doc
test doc `say` . ok
thread 'main' at 'assertion failed: s == "Hello"', main:9

   left: Hello World!
  right: Hello
```

This will parse the code block in the doc comment and run it.

### Annotation for doctest

Code blocks can be annotated with attributes that help `navi test` do the right thing when testing your code:

- `ignore`: Ignore doc test (No compile and run).
- `should_panic`: This code should panic or assert failed.
- `no_run`: This code should pass compile but not run.
- `compile_fail`: This code block should fail to compile.

#### For example:

Expect to ignore (No compile and run)

````nv
/// ```nv,ignore
/// fn foo() {
/// ```
````

Expect to **panic** or **assert failed**

````nv
/// ```nv,should_panic
/// assert_eq 1 == 2;
/// ```
````

Expect to **pass compile** but **not run**

````nv
/// ```nv,no_run
/// loop { };
/// ```
````

Expect to **compile failed**

````nv
/// ```nv,compile_fail
/// a = 1
/// ```
````

## Values {#value}

### Primitive Types

| Type     | Rust Equivalent | Description              | Example                                   |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| [int]    | i64             | A signed integer type    | `1`, `-29`, `0`                           |
| [bool]   | bool            | A boolean type.          | `true`, `false`                           |
| [float]  | f64             | A floating point type    | `1.0`, `-29.0`, `0.0`                     |
| [string] | str             | A immutable UTF-8 string | `"Hello, 世界"`<br>`` `Hello ${1 + 2}` `` |
| [char]   | char            | A single character       | `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`                       |

::: info
💡 Navi only has [int] and [float] types, all `int` are stored as _int64_, and all `float` are stored as _float64_ in internal.

There is no int8, uint8, int16, uint16, int32, uint32, float32, and etc.
:::

### Primitive Values

| Name               | Description                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `true` and `false` | [bool] values                  |
| `nil`              | Set an [optional] value to nil |

### Integer {#int}

In Navi, the `int` type is a signed integer type, and it is 64-bit on all platforms. This means it can hold values from `-9223372036854775808` to `9223372036854775807`.

We don't have uint type or other integer types.

```nv
let n = 246;
let n1 = -100;
```

You can use `_` to separate digits in a number (`int`, `float`), it will be **ignored** by the compiler. This is useful for large numbers.

```nv
let amount = 1_000_000;
let price = 123_456_789.123_456;
```

### Float {#float}

Navi has a `float` type (53 bits of precision), and it is 64-bit on all platforms.

```nv
let v = 3.14;
let v1 = -2.0;
let v2 = 0.0;
let v3 = 10.23e+10;
let v4 = 2.0e+2;
```

### Bool {#bool}

Navi has a `bool` type, and it has two values: `true` and `false`.

```nv, no_run
use std.io;

let passed = true;
if (passed) {
    io.println("Passed!");
} else {
    io.println("Failed!");
}

let passed = false;
```

### String {#string}

String is a UTF-8 string type, and it is immutable in Navi, all string literals are immutable.

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn main() throws {
    let message = "Hello, World 🎉!";

    io.println(message);
    io.println(`chars len: ${message.len()}`);
    io.println(`bytes len: ${message.bytes().len()}`);
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi run
Hello, World 🎉!
chars len: 15
bytes len: 18
```

#### Escape Sequences

| Escape Sequences | Description     |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| `\n`             | Newline         |
| `\r`             | Carriage return |
| `\t`             | Tab             |
| `\\`             | Backslash       |
| `\"`             | Double quote    |
| `\'`             | Single quote    |

If you use `\` in a string outside of an escape sequence, it will be ignored.

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn main() throws {
    io.println("\"Hello, \nWorld!\"");
    io.println("Hello, \\nWorld!");
    io.println("Unknown escape sequence: \a");
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi run
"Hello,
World!"
Hello, \nWorld!
Unknown escape sequence: a
```

### String Interpolation

String interpolation is a way to construct a new String value from a mix of constants, variables, literals, and expressions by including their values inside a [string] literal.

Navi's string interpolation is similar to JavaScript's template literals.

```nv
let name = "World";
let hello = `Hello, ${name}!`;

// You can write multi-line string interpolation.
let hello = `
Hello, ${name}!
`;
```

#### ToString interface

The `ToString` interface is a built-in interface, and it has a `to_string` method, you can use it to convert a value to a string.

If you use any type that implements the `ToString` interface in string interpolation, it will call the `to_string` method to convert the value to a string.

For example:

```nv
struct User {
    name: string
}

impl User {
    pub fn to_string(self): string {
        return self.name;
    }
}

let user = User { name: "Navi" };
let message = `Hello, ${user}!`;
assert_eq message, "Hello, Navi!";
```

### Char

Navi has a `char` type, and it represents a single Unicode scalar value.

```nv
let c = 'a';
let c1: char = '🎉';
```

### Assignment

Use the `let` keyword to declare a variable to an identifier, the variable is mutable.

```nv,no_run
// main.nv
use std.io;

let name = "World";
let pi = 3.14;
let passed = true;

fn main() throws {
    name = "Navi";
    pi = 3.1415926;
    passed = false;
    let message = `Hello ${name}, pi: ${pi}, passed: ${passed}!`;
    io.println(message);
}
```

Output:

```shell
Hello Navi, pi: 3.1415926, passed: false!
```

You can declare a variable with a type.

```nv
let name: string = "World";
let pi: float = 3.14;
let passed: bool = true;
```

Variables must be initialized:

```nv,compile_fail
use std.io;

fn main() throws {
    // This will cause a compile error.
    let name: string;

    name = "Navi";
    io.println(`Hello ${name}!`);
}
```

Output:

```shell
  ┌─ main.nv:4:21
  │
4 │     let name: string;
  │                     ^ unrecognized token: ;, expected tokens: ",", "=", "?"
```

If we change to give a default value, then it will be ok.

```nv, no_run
let name: string = "";
```

### Type Casting

Use `as` to cast a value to a type, this is **zero-cost** type casting.

You can cast a value from [int] to [float], or from [float] to [int].

| FROM  | TO    |
| ----- | ----- |
| int   | float |
| float | int   |
| bool  | int   |

```nv
test "cast" {
    let n = 100 as float;
    assert_eq n, 100.0;

    let n = 3.1415 as int;
    assert_eq n, 3;

    let n = true as int;
    assert_eq n, 1;
    let n = false as int;
    assert_eq n, 0;
}
```

The following are invalid type casting:

```nv,compile_fail
let n = 300 as string; // unable cast type `int` to `string`
let n = 3.1415 as string; // unable cast type `float` to `string`
let n = "10" as int; // unable cast type `string` to `int`
let n = "10" as float; // unable cast type `string` to `float`
let n = 0 as bool; // unable cast type `int` to `bool`
let n = true as float; // unable cast type `bool` to `float`
```

### Type Conversion

Use `parse_int`, and `parse_float` to convert an `string` to a `int` or `float`, the return value is an optional type. If the string value is invalid, it will return `nil`.

Use `to_string` to convert all [Primitive Types] to a `string`, this is always successful.

```nv
test "parse_int" {
    let n = "100".parse_int();
    assert_eq n, 100;

    let n = "abc100".parse_int();
    assert_eq n, nil;

    let n = "100abc".parse_int();
    assert_eq n, nil;

    let n = 3.1415 as int;
    assert_eq n, 3;

    let n = true as int;
    assert_eq n, 1;

    let n = false as int;
    assert_eq n, 0;
}

test "to_float" {
    let n = "100".parse_float();
    assert_eq n, 100.0;

    let n = "3.1415".parse_float();
    assert_eq n, 3.1415;

    let n = "3.9abc".parse_float();
    assert_eq n, nil;

    let n = 3 as float;
    assert_eq n, 3.0;
}

test "to_string" {
    let n = 100.to_string();
    assert_eq n, "100";

    let n = 3.1415.to_string();
    assert_eq n, "3.1415";

    let n = true.to_string();
    assert_eq n, "true";

    let n = false.to_string();
    assert_eq n, "false";
}
```

## Testing

You can use the `test` keyword to declare a test function in any Navi file, it will be run when you execute `navi test`.

There are built-in `assert`, `assert_eq`, and `assert_ne` keyword for assertion.

```nv
use std.io;

fn say(name: string): string {
    return `Hello ${name}!`;
}

test "say" {
    let message = say("World");
    assert message == "Hello World!";
    assert_eq message, "Hello World!";
    assert_ne message, "";
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi test
test main.nv . ok
All 1 tests 1 passed finished in 0.03s
```

Like `navi run`, you can use `navi test main.nv` to run a specific file, if you don't pass a file name, it will run all files in the current directory (Like `navi test .`).

The code in the `test` block will be ignored by the compiler when you execute `navi run`.

### Test Declarations

You can use the `test` keyword to declare a test function, followed by a string literal as the test name, and then a block of code.

The `test` block can at anywhere in a Navi file, but it is recommended to put it at the end of the file.

```nv
use std.io;

fn say(name: string): string {
    return `Hello ${name}!`;
}

// Here is ok
test "say" {
    let message = say("World");
    assert message == "Hello World!";
    assert_eq message, "Hello World!";
    assert_ne message, "";
}

fn add(a: int, b: int): int {
    return a + b;
}

test "add" {
    let result = add(1, 2);
    assert result == 3;
    assert_eq result, 3;
    assert_ne result, 0;
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi test
test main.nv .. ok in 1ms
All 2 tests 2 passed finished in 0.02s.
```

### Test Failures

The test runner will print the error message when a test fails, and with an `exit 1` code to let CI know the test failed.

```nv
test "expect to fail" {
    assert true == false;
}

test "expect to fail with message" {
    assert_eq 1, 2, "1 != 2";
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi test
Testing
test main.nv .. fail in 708ms

  main expect to fail
    thread 'thread 1#' at 'assertion failed: true == false', main.nv:2

    stack backtrace:
      0: test#0()
        at main.nv:2

  main expect to fail with message
    thread 'thread 1#' at '1 != 2', main.nv:6

       left: 1
      right: 2

    stack backtrace:
      0: test#1()
        at main.nv:6

All 2 tests 0 passed, 2 failed finished in 0.79s.
```

## Variable

### Declarations

The syntax of variable declarations is:

```
[<declaration_mode>] :[<type>] <identifier> = <expression>
```

where:

- `declaration_mode` - is the variable mode, we can use `let`, `cost`.
  - `let` - declare a mutable variable.
  - `const` - declare an immutable variable.
- `type` - used to declare the variable type, such as `int`, `string`, or a optional type `int?`, `string?`.
- `identifier` - variable name.
- `expression` - the value of the variable, can be any expression.

### Identifier

An identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, struct, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter or underscore `_`, followed by any number of letters, underscores, or digits.

It is recommended to use `snake_case` for identifiers, e.g. `my_var`, `my_function_name`.

They must not be a keyword. See [Keywords](#keywords) for a list of reserved keywords.

The following are valid identifiers:

```nv
const name = "World";
let _name = "World";
let name_ = "World";
let _name_ = "World";
let name1 = "World";
```

And they are invalid identifiers:

```nv,compile_fail
let 1name = "World";
let name-1 = "World";
// `use` is a keyword.
let use = "World";
```

### Variable Scope

Variables are scoped to the block in which they are declared. A block is a collection of statements enclosed by `{}`.

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

const name = "Name in global scope";

fn main() throws {
    let name = "World";
    io.println(`Hello ${name}!`);

    foo();
}

fn foo() {
    io.println(`Hello ${name}!`);
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi run
Hello World!
Hello Navi!
Hello World!
Hello Name in global scope!
```

### Const

The `const` keyword is used to declare an immutable variable, and it must have a value. When the value is assigned, it can't be changed.

```nv
const page_size = 200;
```

## Operator

Like other programming languages, Navi has a set of operators for performing arithmetic and logical operations.

| Operator   | Relevant Types                       | Description                                                                      | Example      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |

| `*=`       | [int], [float]                       | Multiplication                                                                   | `a *= 1`     |
| `/`        | [int], [float]                       | Division.<br/>Can cause Division by Zero for integers.                           | `1 / 2`      |

| `%`        | [int], [float]                       | Modulo                                                                           | `1 % 2`      |
| `%=`       | [int], [float]                       | Modulo                                                                           | `a %= 1`     |

| `a != b`   | [int], [float], [bool], [string] ... | `a` not equal to `b`                                                             | `1 != 2`     |
| `a != nil` | [optional]                           | An [optional] value not equal to nil                                             | `a != nil`   |

```nv
test "test" {
    assert 1 + 2 == 3;
    assert 1 - 2 == -1;
    assert 1 * 2 == 2;
    assert 1 / 2 == 0;
    assert 1 % 2 == 1;
    assert 1 == 1;
    assert 1 != 2;
    assert 1 < 2;
    assert 1 <= 2;
    assert 1 > 0;
    assert 1 >= 0;
    assert -1 == -1;

    let a: string? = nil;
    assert a?.len() == nil;
    let a: string? = "Hello";
    assert a?.len() == 5;
}

test "test assignment" {
    let a = 1;
    a += 1;
    assert a == 2;

    a -= 1;
    assert a == 1;

    a *= 2;
    assert a == 2;

    a /= 2;
    assert a == 1;

    let a = 10;
    a %= 3;
    assert a == 1;
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi test
Testing .
test main.nv .. ok in 1ms
All 2 tests 2 passed finished in 0.02s.
```

## Array

Array is a collection of items, in Navi array is a mutable collection.

Use `[type] {}` to declare an array, every array must have a type, you can't create an array without a type.

```nv
struct Item {
    name: string
}

test "array" {
    let a: [int] = [int] { 1, 2, 3 };
    let b = [string] { "Rust", "Navi" };

    assert a.len() == 3;
    assert b.len() == 2;

    // get array item
    assert a[1] == 2;
    assert b[0] == "Rust";

    // set array item
    a[1] = 3;
    assert a[1] == 3;

    // Init a struct array
    let items = [Item] {
        Item { name: "foo" },
        Item { name: "bar" },
        Item { name: "baz" }
    };
    assert_eq items[2].name, "baz";


}
```

If you declare the array type, then you can assign an array without the type prefix.

```nv
let items: [string] = { "Rust", "Navi" };

fn receive_method(items: [string]) {
    // ...
}

receive_method({ "Rust", "Navi" });
```

### Get & Set Item

Use `[idx]`, `[idx]=` to get and set an item from the array, the index must be an [int] type.

```nv,should_panic
let a = [string] { "Rust", "Navi" };

a[0]; // "Rust"
a[1]; // "Navi"
a[2]; // panic: index out of bounds

a[0] = "Rust 1";
a[0]; // "Rust 1"
```

### Mutate Array

There are `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift` ... methods in Array, you can use them to mutate an array.

```nv
test "push | pop" {
    let items = [string] {};
    items.push("foo");
    items.push("bar");

    assert_eq items.len(), 2;
    assert_eq items[0], "foo";
    assert_eq items[1], "bar";

    assert_eq items.pop(), "bar";
    assert_eq items.pop(), "foo";
    assert_eq items.pop(), nil;
}

test "shift | unshift" {
    let items = [string] {};
    items.unshift("foo");
    items.unshift("bar");

    assert_eq items.len(), 2;
    assert_eq items[0], "bar";
    assert_eq items[1], "foo";

    assert_eq items.shift(), "bar";
    assert_eq items.len(), 1;
    assert_eq items.shift(), "foo";
    assert_eq items.len(), 0;
    assert_eq items.shift(), nil;

    let items = [string] { "foo", "bar" };
    assert_eq items.shift(), "foo";
    assert_eq items.len(), 1;
    assert_eq items.shift(), "bar";
    assert_eq items.len(), 0;
    assert_eq items.shift(), nil;
}
```

### Nested Array

The array can be nested.

```nv
let items = [[string]] {
    [string] { "foo", "bar" },
    [string] { "baz", "qux" }
};
let numbers = [[int]] {
    [int] { 1, 2 },
    [int] { 3, 4 }
};
```

## Struct

The Navi struct is a collection of fields, and it is a [value] type, it's like a struct in Go and Rust.

### Declare a Struct

Use the `struct` keyword to declare a struct, and use `.` to access a field.

- The struct name must be an [identifier] with `CamelCase` style, e.g.: `User`, `UserGroup`, `UserGroupItem`.
- And the field name must be an [identifier], with `snake_case` style, e.g.: `user_name`, `user_group`, `user_group_item`.
- The filed type can be a type or an [optional] type.
- The field can have a default value, e.g.: `confirmed: bool = false`, and then you can create a struct instance without the `confirmed` field.

```nv
struct User {
    name: string,
    id: int,
    profile: Profile?,
    // default value is `false`
    confirmed: bool = false,
}

struct Profile {
    bio: string?,
    city: string?,
    tags: [string] = [string] {},
}
```

To create a struct instance, use `StructName { field: value }` syntax.

If the variable name is the same as the field name, you can assign it in short syntax, e.g.: `name` is the same as `name: name`.

```nv, ignore
let name = "Jason Lee";
let id = 100;
let user = User { id, name }; // This is same like `User { id: id, name: name }`
```

::: info
In the current version, you must assign `nil` to an [optional] field if you don't want to set a [value].

We will support [optional] field default value to `nil` in the future.
:::

```nv, ignore
test "user" {
    let user = User {
        name: "Jason Lee",
        id: 1,
        profile: {
            bio: nil,
            city: "Chengdu",
        },
    };

    assert_eq user.name, "Jason Lee";
    assert_eq user.confirmed, false;
    assert_eq user.profile?.bio, nil;
    assert_eq user.profile?.city, "Chengdu";
    assert_eq user.tags.len(), 0;
}
```

### Implement a Struct

Use `impl` to declare a struct method. The `self` is a keyword, it is a reference to the current struct instance.
Unlike Rust, you don't need to declare `self` as the first parameter.

Use `impl .. for` to implement a interface for a struct. This is a optional way for let us write a clearly code, if the struct have a method can matched the interface, it same as the `impl .. for` implementation.

```nv, ignore
impl User {
    fn new(name: string): User {
        return User {
            name: name,
            id: 0,
            profile: nil,
        };
    }

    fn say(self): string {
        return `Hello ${self.name}!`;
    }
}

impl ToString for User {
    fn to_string(self): string {
        return self.name;
    }
}
```

- `new` is a **Static Method**, and it can be called by `User.new`.
- `say` is an **Instance Method**, and it can be called by `user.say()`.

```nv, ignore
fn main() throws {
    let user = User.new("Sunli", 1);
    io.println(user.say());
}
```

### Struct Attributes

Use `#[serde(attr = ...)]` to declare a struct serialize and deserialize attributes.

#### `#[serde(rename_all = "...")]`

Rename all the fields (if this is a struct) or variants (if this is an enum) according to the given case convention. The possible values are `"lowercase"`, `"UPPERCASE"`, `"PascalCase"`, `"camelCase"`, `"snake_case"`, `"SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE"`, `"kebab-case"`, `"SCREAMING-KEBAB-CASE"`.

```nv, ignore
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
struct User {
    user_name: string,
    user_group: string,
}
```

Output:

```json
{
  "userName": "Sunli",
  "userGroup": "Admin"
}
```

#### `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`

Always error during deserialization when encountering unknown fields. When this attribute is not present, by default unknown fields are ignored for self-describing formats like JSON.

::: info NOTE
This attribute is not supported in combination with `flatten`, neither on the outer struct nor on the flattened field.
:::

```nv, ignore
#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]
struct User {
    user_name: string,
    user_group: string,
}
```

If we have a source JSON like this:

```json
{
  "user_name": "Sunli",
  "user_group": "Admin",
  "unknown_field": "unknown"
}
```

In this case, we still can deserialize the JSON to a struct, but the `unknown_field` will be ignored.

```nv, ignore
use std.json;

let user = json.parse::<User>(`{ "user_name": "Sunli", "user_group": "Admin", "unknown_field": "unknown" }`);
assert_eq user.user_name, "Sunli";
```

### Field Attributes

#### `#[serde(rename = "...")]`

Serialize and deserialize this field with the given name instead of its Rust name. This is useful for serializing fields as camelCase or serializing fields with names that are reserved Rust keywords.

```nv, ignore
struct User {
    #[serde(rename = "name")]
    user_name: string,
    #[serde(rename = "team")]
    user_group: string,
}
```

Output:

```json
{
  "name": "Sunli",
  "team": "Admin"
}
```

#### `#[serde(alias = "name")]`

Deserialize this field from the given name or from its Navi name. May be repeated to specify multiple possible names for the same field.

```nv, ignore
struct User {
    #[serde(alias = "name")]
    user_name: string,
    #[serde(alias = "team")]
    user_group: string,
}
```

So both JSONs are valid:

```json
{
  "name": "Sunli",
  "team": "Admin"
}
```

```json
{
  "user_name": "Sunli",
  "user_group": "Admin"
}
```

#### `#[serde(skip)]`

Skip this field: do not serialize or deserialize it. The `skip` field must have a default value, otherwise, it will cause a compile error.

```nv, ignore
struct User {
    name: string,
    #[serde(skip)]
    group: string = "Other",
}
```

Output:

```json
{
  "name": "Sunli"
}
```

And also can deserialize the JSON without the `group` field.

```nv, ignore
use std.json;

let user = json.parse::<User>(`{ "name": "Sunli", "group": "Admin" }`);
assert_eq user.name, "Sunli";
// The `group` field is described with `skip`, so it will be ignored, we still get that default value.
assert_eq user.group, "Other";
```

#### `#[serde(flatten)]`

Flatten the contents of this field into the container it is defined in.

This removes one level of structure between the serialized representation and the Rust data structure representation. It can be used for factoring common keys into a shared structure, or for capturing remaining fields into a map with arbitrary string keys.

::: info NOTE
This attribute is not supported in combination with structs that use `deny_unknown_fields`. Neither the outer nor inner flattened struct should use that attribute.
:::

##### Flatten a struct fields

In some cases, we want to flatten a struct field to the parent struct. So we can use `#[serde(flatten)]` to do that.

```nv, ignore
struct User {
    name: string,
    #[serde(flatten)]
    profile: Profile,
}

struct Profile {
    bio: string,
    city: string,
}
```

Now all fields in the `Profile` struct will be flattened to the `User` struct after serialization.

```json
{
  "name": "Sunli",
  "bio": "Hello, World!",
  "city": "Wuhan"
}
```

##### Capture additional fields

A field of map type can be flattened to hold additional data that is not captured by any other fields of the struct.

```nv, ignore
struct User {
    name: string,
    #[serde(flatten)]
    extra: <string, any>,
}
```

For example, we have a lot of unknown fields in the JSON, the all unknown fields will be captured to the `extra` field.

```json
{
  "name": "Sunli",
  "bio": "Hello, World!",
  "city": "Wuhan"
}
```

```nv, ignore
use std.json;

let user = json.parse::<User>(`{ "name": "Sunli", "bio": "Hello, World!", "city": "Wuhan" }`);
assert_eq user.name, "Sunli";
assert_eq user.extra["bio"], "Hello, World!";
assert_eq user.extra["city"], "Wuhan";
```

## Enum

The Navi `enum` is a collection of variants, and it is a [value] type.

### Declare an Enum

Use `enum` keyword to declare an enum, and use `.` to access a variant. Enum only be an [int] type.

```nv
enum UserRole {
    Admin,
    User,
    Guest,
}
```

The first variant will be `0`, the second variant will be `1`, and so on in order.

```nv
enum UserRole {
    Admin = 100,
    User = 101,
    Guest = 103,
}
```

### Convert to a value

Use `as` to convert an enum to a value, this is zero-cost.

```nv, ignore
let a = UserRole.Admin as int;
assert_eq a, 100;
```

### Enum Annotations

Like the struct, `enum` also has annotations for declaring serialize and deserialize attributes.

#### Enum Attributes

##### `#[serde(int)]`

Serialize and deserialize this enum as an integer.

```nv, ignore
#[serde(int)]
enum UserRole {
    Admin,
    User,
    Guest,
}

struct User {
    role: UserRole,
}
```

If present, the serialized representation of the enum will be an integer.

```json
{
  "role": 100
}
```

Otherwise will use the enum field name as the serialized representation.

```json
{
  "role": "Admin"
}
```

##### `#[serde(rename_all = "...")]`

This is the same as the struct `#[serde(rename_all = "...")]`. See [Struct Attributes](#struct-attributes).

Please note that the `rename_all` attribute is not supported in combination with `#[serde(int)]`.

#### Enum Item Attributes

The enum item also has annotations for declaring serialize and deserialize attributes.

##### `#[serde(rename = "...")]`

This is the same as the struct `#[serde(rename = "...")]`. See [Struct Attributes](#struct-attributes).

##### `#[serde(alias = "...")]`

This is the same as the struct `#[serde(alias = "...")]`. See [Struct Attributes](#struct-attributes).

## Interface

The Navi interface is a collection of methods, and it is a [value] type, it's like an interface in Go.

### Declare an Interface

Use the `interface` keyword to declare an interface, and use `.` to access a method.

- The interface name must be an [identifier] with `CamelCase` style, we recommend named interface use a verb, e.g.: `ToString`, `Read`, `Write`.
- And the method name must be an [identifier], with `snake_case` style, e.g.: `to_string`, `read`, `write`.
- We can write a default implementation for a method, and it will be used if the struct does not implement the method.
- The first argument of the method must be `self`, it is a reference to the current struct instance.

```nv
interface ToString {
    pub fn to_string(self): string;
}

interface Read {
    fn read(self): string;

    fn read_all(self): string {
        // This is the default implementation, if the struct does not implement this method, it will be used.
        return "";
    }
}

fn read_all(reader: Read): ToString {
    let s = reader.read();
    // Navi's string has a `to_string` method.
    return s;
}
```

### Implement an Interface

If any struct has all methods of an interface, it will implement the interface.

```nv
interface ToString {
    fn to_string(self): string;
}

interface Reader {
    fn read(self): string;
}

struct User {
    name: string
}

impl User {
    fn to_string(self): string {
        return `${self.name}`;
    }

    fn read(self): string {
        return `Hello ${self.name}!`;
    }
}
```

Now we can use a `User` type as a `ToString` or a `Read` interface.

```nv, ignore
fn foo(item: ToString) {
    io.println(item.to_string());
}

fn read_info(item: Reader) {
    io.println(item.read());
}

fn main() throws {
    let user = User {
        name: "Sunli",
    };

    foo(user);
    read_info(user);
}
```

### Type Assertion

Use `.(type)` to assert an interface to a type.

```nv, compile_fail
interface ToString {
    fn to_string(): string;
}

struct User {
}

impl User {
    fn to_string(): string {
        return "User";
    }
}

let a: ToString = "hello";
// Cast a from interface to string.
let b = a.(string);
// now b is a `string`.

let user: ToString = User {};
// Cast user from interface to User.
let user = user.(User);
// now use is `User`.
let user = user.(string); // panic: User can't cast to a string.
```

## Switch

The `switch` statement is used to execute one of many blocks of code.

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn get_message(n: int): string {
    let message = "";

    switch (n) {
        case 1:
            message = "One";
        case 2:
            message = "Two";
        default:
            message = "Other";
    }

    return message;
}

fn main() throws {
    io.println(get_message(1));
    io.println(get_message(2));
    io.println(get_message(3));
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi run
One
Two
Other
```

Use the `switch` keyword to declare a switch statement, the condition must have `()` and return a value. And use `case` and `default` to declare a case.
The `default` case is optional, which means if the condition does not match any case, it will execute the `default` case.

You can also use `{}` to declare a [block] in case of more complex logic.

```nv
fn get_message(n: int): string {
    let message = "";
    switch (n) {
        case 1:
            message = "One";
        case 2:
            message = "Two";
        default:
            message = "Other";
    }

    return message;
}
```

### Type switch

The `switch` can also used to assert the dynamic type of an interface variable. Use `let t = val.(type)` to assert the type of `val` in the switch condition.

```nv
fn type_name(val: any): string {
    switch (let t = val.(type)) {
    case int:
        return "int";
    case string:
        return "string";
    case float:
        return "float";
    case bool:
        return "bool";
    case <string, int>:
        return "map";
    default:
        return "unknown";
    }
}

test "type_name" {
    assert_eq type_name(1), "int";
    assert_eq type_name("hello"), "string";
    assert_eq type_name(3.14), "float";
    assert_eq type_name(true), "bool";
    assert_eq type_name(<string, int> {}), "map";
    assert_eq type_name([int] {}), "unknown";
}
```

## While

A while loop is used to repeatedly execute an expression until some condition is no longer true.

Use the `while` keyword to declare a while loop, the condition is an [expression] in `()` that returns a [bool] value.

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn main() throws {
    let n = 0;
    while (n < 5) {
        io.println(`${n}`);
        n += 1;
    }
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi run
0
1
2
3
4
```

Use the `break` keyword to exit a while loop.

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn main() throws {
    let n = 0;
    while (true) {
        io.println(`${n}`);
        n += 1;
        if (n == 2) {
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi run
0
1
```

Use `continue` to jump back to the beginning of the loop.

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn main() throws {
    let n = 0;
    while (n < 5) {
        n += 1;
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            continue;
        }
        io.println(`${n}`);
    }
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi run
1
3
5
```

## For

For loops are used to iterate over a range, an array, or a map.

Like `while` loop, you can use `break` and `continue` to control the loop.

### Iter a Range {#range}

The range `start..end` contains all values with `start <= x < end`. It is empty if `start >= end`.

The `for (let i in start..end)` statement is used to iterate over a `range`.

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn main() throws {
    for (let n in 0..5) {
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            continue;
        }
        io.println(`n: ${n}`);
    }
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi run
n: 1
n: 3
```

Use the `step` method to create a new range with a step.

```nv
let items = [int] {};
for (let i in (1..10).step(2)) {
    items.push(i);
}
assert_eq items, [int] { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 };
```

### Iter an Array

The `for (let item in array)` statement is used to iterate over an [array].

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn main() throws {
    let items = [string] { "foo", "bar", "baz" };
    for (let item in items) {
        io.println(item);
    }
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi run
foo
bar
baz
```

### Iter a Map

The `for (let k, v in map)` statement is used to iterate over a [map].

```nv
let items = <string, string> {
    "title": "Navi",
    "url": "https://navi-lang.org"
};

let result = [string] {};
for (let k, v in items) {
    result.push(`${k}: ${v}`);
}
assert_eq result.join(", "), "title: Navi, url: https://navi-lang.org";
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi run
title: Navi
url: https://navi-lang.org
```

## If

Like most programming languages, Navi has the `if` statement for conditional execution.

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn main() throws {
    let n = 1;
    if (n == 1) {
        io.println("One");
    } else if (n == 2) {
        io.println("Two");
    } else if (n == 3) {
        io.println("Three");
    } else {
        io.println("Other");
    }
}
```

### If let

The `if let` statement is used to match an [optional] value.

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn get_a(a: string?) {
    if (let a = a) {
        io.println(a);
    } else {
        io.println("a is nil");
    }
}

fn main() throws {
    get_a("foo");
    get_a(nil);
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi run
foo
a is nil
```

## Function

Use `fn` keyword to declare a function, the function name must be an [identifier], and the function body must be a [block].

::: info
Navi recommends using `snake_case` for the function name, e.g.: `send_message`, `get_user`, `get_user_by_id`.

And the argument name also uses `snake_case`, e.g.: `title`, `user_id`.
:::

You can define a function at the module level, or in a struct `impl` block.

- The function name must be an [identifier].
- The arguments can be [normal arguments], [keyword arguments] or [arbitrary arguments].

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn add(a: int, b: int, args: ..string, mode: string = "+"): string {
    let result = a + b;
    return `${a} + ${b} = ${result}`;
}

struct User {
    name: string,
}

impl User {
    fn say(self): string {
        return `Hello ${self.name}!`;
    }
}

fn main() throws {
    io.println(add(1, 2));
    let user = User { name: "Navi" };
    io.println(user.say());
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi run
a + b = 3
Hello Navi!
```

### Positional Arguments

Positional arguments are arguments that are passed by position.

Use `name: type` to declare a positional argument, you can put a positional argument after the keyword argument.

```nv
fn add(a: int, b: int, mode: string = "+"): string {
    let result = a + b;
    return `${a} + ${b} = ${result}`;
}
```

To define an [optional] type for an argument, we use `?` after the type, e.g.: `b: int?`.

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn add(a: int, b: int?): string {
    // unwrap b or default to 0
    let b = b || 0;

    let result = a + b;
    return `${a} + ${b} = ${result}`;
}

fn main() throws {
    io.println(add(1, 2));
    io.println(add(1, nil));
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi run
1 + 2 = 3
1 + 0 = 1
```

### Arbitrary Arguments

Use `..type` to declare an arbitrary argument, the arbitrary argument must be the **last** argument (Except Keyword Arguments).

This is means you can pass any number of arguments to the function. And this argument will be as an array in the function body.

```nv
fn add(one: int, others: ..int): int {
    // The `others` is `[int]` type.
    let result = one;
    for (let n in others) {
        result += n;
    }
    return result;
}

assert_eq add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), 15;

let others = [int] { 2, 3, 4, 5 };
assert_eq add(1, ..others), 15;
```

### Keyword Arguments

Keyword arguments (Kw Args) are arguments that are passed by name. They are useful when a function has many arguments or default arguments.

Use `name: value = default` to declare a keyword argument, the keyword argument must be after positional arguments.

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn add(a: int, b: int, mode: string = "+", debug: bool = false): string {
    if (debug) {
        return `a: ${a}, b: ${b}, mode: ${mode}`;
    }

    let result: int = 0;

    if (mode == "-") {
        result = a + b;
    } else {
        result = a - b;
    }

    return `${a} ${mode} ${b} = ${result}`;
}

fn main() throws {
    io.println(add(1, 2));
    io.println(add(1, 2, mode: "+"));
    io.println(add(1, 2, mode: "-"));
    io.println(add(1, 2, mode: "-", debug: true));
    io.println(add(1, 2, debug: true, mode: "+"));
    io.println(add(1, 2, debug: true));
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi run
1 + 2 = -1
1 + 2 = -1
1 - 2 = 3
a: 1, b: 2, mode: -
a: 1, b: 2, mode: +
a: 1, b: 2, mode: +
```

### Function to a Variable

In Navi, the Function is the first-class citizen, it can be assigned to a variable, and it can be passed as an argument to another function.

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn add(a: int, b: int): string {
	return `${a + b}`;
}

struct User {
    name: string,
}

impl User {
    fn say(self): string {
        return `Hello ${self.name}!`;
    }
}

fn main() throws {
	let add_fn = add;
	io.println(add_fn(1, 2));

    let user = User { name: "Navi" };
    let say_fn = user.say;
    io.println(say_fn());
}
```

## Closure

A closure is a function that captures the environment in which it was created. It can capture variables from the surrounding scope.

- The closure type just use `|(type, type): return_type|`.
- If there is no parameter, use `|(): return_type|`.
- If no return type, use `|(type, type)|`.
- If no parameter and return type, use `|()|`.

```nv
fn call_add(f: |(int, int): int|): int {
  return f(2, 3);
}
let add: |(int, int): int| = |a, b| {
  return a + b;
};
assert_eq add(1, 2), 3;
assert_eq call_add(add), 5;

fn call_add1(f: |(): int|): int {
  return f() + 2;
}
assert_eq call_add1(|| {
    return 3;
}), 5;

fn call_add2(f: |()|): int {
    f();
    return  2;
}
assert_eq call_add2(|| {
    // do something without return
}), 2;
```

## Optional

Navi provides a modern optional type, which is similar to Rust's `Option` type, to give us a safe way to handle `nil` value, we can avoid the `null pointer exception` in runtime.

Use `type?` to declare an optional type, e.g.: `string?`, `int?`, `float?`, `bool?`, `User?` ...

```nv
// a normal string
let name: string = "Navi";

// an optional string
let optional_name: string? = "Navi";
let optional_name: string? = nil;
```

Now the `optional_name` is an [optional] type, it can be a [string] or `nil`.

### Unwrap Optional

The `!` operator is used to unwrap an [optional] value, if the value is `nil`, it will panic.
It is useful when you want to get a [value] from an [optional] value and you are sure it is not `nil`.

::: warning NOTE
To keep your code safe, when you use `!`, you must be sure it is not `nil`.

If not, don't use it, the [value || default](#unwrap-or-default) is a better way to get a [value] from an [optional] value.
:::

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn main() throws {
    let name: string? = "Navi";
    // This is ok.
    io.println(name!);

    let name: string? = nil;
    // This will cause a panic.
    io.println(name!);
}
```

### Unwrap or Default

The `||` operator is used to unwrap an [optional] value, if the value is `nil`, it will return the default value.

The right side of `||` can be a [value] or an [expression] that returns a [value], if the left side is not nill, the right side will not be evaluated.

```nv
use std.io;

test "unwrap or default" {
    let name: string? = "Navi";
    let result = name || "";
    // result is a string type
    assert_eq result, "Navi";

    let name: string? = nil;
    let result = name || "";
    // result is a string type
    assert_eq result, "";
}
```

## Error

The `throws` keyword on a function to describe that the function can be thrown an error.

::: warning NOTE
All functions whose signature is `throws` must use `try`, `try?` or `try!` keyword before it when you call it.
:::

| Keyword   | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `throws`  | The function can throw an error.                             |
| `try`     | The error will be thrown, if the function throws an error.   |
| `try?`    | If error is thrown, the `try?` will return `nil`.            |
| `try!`    | If error is thrown, the `try!` will panic.                   |
| `throw`   | Throw an error.                                              |
| `do`      | The `do` block is used to handle an error.                   |
| `catch`   | The `catch` block is used to match an error interface.       |
| `finally` | The `finally` block is optional, it will always be executed. |

### Error Type

By default, `throw` can throw with a [string] or a custom error type that implements the `error` interface.

::: info TIP
Because Navi has implemented the `error` interface for [string], you can throw a [string] directly.
:::

```nv
interface error {
    fn error(self): string;
}
```

So you can just throw [string]:

```nv, ignore
throw "error message";
```

Or implement the `error` interface for a custom error type:

```nv, ignore
struct MyError {
    message: string
}

impl MyError {
    // Implement the `error` method for `MyError` struct, then `MyError` can be used as an `error` interface.
    fn error(self): string {
        return self.message;
    }
}
```

We can use `throws` to declare an error type or keep it empty to use default error.

```nv, ignore
fn hello(name: string): string throws {
    if (name == "Navi") {
        throw "name can't be Navi";
    }
    return `Hello ${name}!`;
}

fn hello_with_custom_error(name: string): string throws MyError {
    if (name == "Navi") {
        throw MyError { message: "name can't be Navi" };
    }
    return `Hello ${name}!`;
}
```

For example:

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn hello(name: string): string throws {
    if (name == "Navi") {
        throw "name can't be Navi";
    }
    return `Hello ${name}!`;
}

fn main() throws {
    let result = try? hello("Navi");
    io.println(`${result || ""}`);
}
```

### Catch Error

Use `do ... catch` statement to catch an error.

- In the `do` block, you must use `try` keyword before all functions that can throw an error.
- The `catch` block is used to match an error interface, it can have multiple `catch` blocks to match different error types.
- And the `finally` block is optional, it will always be executed.

Every type that implements the `error` method can be used as an `error` interface.

```nv,ignore
use std.io;

struct MyError {
    message: string
}

impl MyError {
    // Implement the `error` method for `MyError` struct, then `MyError` can be used as an error interface.
    fn error(): string {
        return self.message;
    }
}

fn hello(name: string): string throws {
    if (name == "Navi") {
        throw "name can't be Navi";
    }
    return `Hello ${name}!`;
}

do {
    let result = try hello("Navi");
    io.println(result);
    let result1 = try hello("Sunli");
} catch (e) {
    io.println(e.error());
} catch (e: MyError) {
    // ...
} finally {
    // This block always be executed.
}
```

### Handle Error

#### try

If the function throws an error, the `try` will throw the error.

```nv, no_run
fn hello(name: string): string throws {
    if (name == "Navi") {
        throw "name can't be Navi";
    }
    return `Hello ${name}!`;
}

fn main() throws {
    let result = try hello("Navi");
    // if error is thrown, the `try` will throw the error.
}
```

#### try?

If the function throws an error, the `try?` will return `nil`.

```nv, ignore
let result = try? hello("Navi");
assert_eq result, nil;

let result = try? hello("Sunli");
assert_eq result, "Hello Sunli!";
```

#### try!

If the function throws an error, the `try!` will panic.

```nv, ignore
let result = try! hello("Navi");
// This will cause a panic
```

## Use

The `use` keyword is used to import a module from the standard library or a file.

```nv
use std.io;
use std.url.URL;

fn main() throws {
    let url = try URL.parse("https://navi-lang.org");
    assert_eq url.host(), "navi-lang.org";
}
```

When you import, the last part of the module name is the name of the module, e.g.: `use std.io` to `io`, `std.url.URL` to `URL`, `std.net.http` to `http`.

### Alias

Sometimes we may want to use a different name for a module, we can use `as` to import a module with an alias.

```nv
use std.url.URL as BaseURL;

let url = try! BaseURL.parse("https://navi-lang.org");
assert_eq url.host(), "navi-lang.org";
```

### Use multiple modules

We can use multiple modules by one `use`.

```nv
use std.{io, url.URL};

fn main() throws {
    let url = try URL.parse("https://navi-lang.org");
    assert_eq url.host(), "navi-lang.org";
}
```

### Import a Module from local

In Navi, a folder in the current directory is a module, and the module name is the folder name.

For example, we have a struct:

```shell
$ tree
main.nv
models
|── profile
|   |── a.nv
|   └── b.nv
└── user.nv
utils
|── string.nv
└── url.nv
```

Now you can import them in `main.nv`:

```nv,ignore
use models;
use models.profile;
use utils;
```

## Module System

In Navi a folder in the current directory is a module, and the module name is the folder name.

- The root directory is the `main` module, and uses `main.nv` as the entry file by default.
- The any sub-directory as a sub-module, and `use` the directory name as the module name.
- The root directory can have multiple entry files, and you can use `navi run filename.nv` to run it directly.
- The `pub` keyword is used to export a `struct`, `struct field`, `interface`, `function`, `type`, `enum`, `const`, `let`, then the other modules can use it.

For example, we have a project like this:

```shell
$ tree
main.nv
utils.nv
models
|── user_profile.nv
|── user_profile
|   |── profile_a.nv
|   └── profile_b.nv
config
|── config_a.nv
└── config_b.nv
```

In this case:

- `main.nv`, `utils.nv` files are in the `main` module, they can access and share members with each other.
- `models` directory is a module named `models`.
- `models/user_profile.nv` will be compiled into `models` module.
- `models/user_profile` directory is a module named `models.user_profile`.
- `modles/user_profile/*.nv` files will be compiled into `models.user_profile` module, they are same like one file.
- `config` directory is a module named `config`.
- `config/*.nv` files will be compiled to the `config` module, they are the same as one file.

::: warning NOTE
If your project has multiple sub-modules, you need to link them by `use` keyword to let the Navi compiler know the module dependency.

Only the used modules will be compiled, this means `navi test` or other commands will not find the sub-directory modules if you don't use them.
:::

For example, in `main.nv`:

```nv, ignore
use models;
use config;

fn main() throws {
}
```

## Type alias

Use `type` keyword to create a type alias.

```nv
type Key = string;
type Value = int;

type MyInfo = <Key, Value>;

let info: MyInfo = {
    "foo": 1,
    "bar": 2,
};

assert_eq info["foo"], 1;
assert_eq info["bar"], 2;
```

### Type Implementation

You can use `impl` to implement some method to a type alias.

::: warning NOTE
The type alias is not a new type, it is just an alias of the original type, so when you implement that type, the original type will also be changed.
:::

```nv
struct User {
    name: string,
}

type NewUser = User;

impl NewUser {
    fn new_method(self) {
    }
}
```

After this implementation, the `User` type will also have the `new_method` method.

## Union Type

The union type allows us to combine two or more types into one type.

```nv
fn to_string(val: int | string | float): string {
    switch (let val = val.(type)) {
        case int:
            return `int: ${val}`;
        case float:
            return `float: ${val}`;
        case string:
            return `string: ${val}`;
    }
}

assert_eq to_string(1), "int: 1";
assert_eq to_string(3.14), "float: 3.14";
assert_eq to_string("hello"), "string: hello";
```

It also can be used as a struct field type.

```nv
struct User {
    stuff_number: int | string,
}

let user = User {
    stuff_number: 1,
};
let user = User {
    stuff_number: "one",
};
```

Or with return type.

```nv
fn get_stuff_number(): (int | string) {
    return 1;
}
```

## Defer

The `defer` keyword is used to execute a block of code when the current function returns.

This is most like Go's `defer` keyword. It is useful when you want to do some cleanup work, e.g.: close a file, close a database connection, etc.

```nv, no_run
use std.io;

fn main() throws {
    defer {
        io.println("defer 1");
    }
    defer {
        io.println("defer 2");
    }
    io.println("Hello");
}
```

Output:

```shell
$ navi run
Hello
defer 2
defer 1
```

## Spawn

Navi has a `spawn` keyword for spawn a coroutine, it is similar to Go's `go` keyword.

```nv,no_run
use std.io;

fn main() throws {
    spawn {
        io.println("Hello");
    }
    io.println("World");
}
```

Unlike Go, Navi is a single-thread language, so the `spawn` is to make code run concurrently, not parallelism.

> Graph from [Concurrency is NOT Parallelism]

- [Concurrency is NOT Parallelism]

## Channel

The `channel` is a communication mechanism that allows one goroutine to send values to another goroutine.

Use `channel` to create a channel, and use `send` to send a value to the channel, and use `recv` to receive a value from the channel.

```nv,no_run
let ch = channel::<int>();

spawn {
    let i = 1;
    while (i <= 10) {
        ch.send(i);
        i += 1;
    }
}

let i = 1;
while (i <= 10) {
    let value = ch.recv();
    assert value == i;
    i += 1;
}
```

## Keywords

The following are reserved keywords in Navi, they can't be used as [identifier].

| Keyword                     | Description                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `as`                        | Convert a value to a type.                                                                 |
| `assert_eq`                 | assert equal                                                                               |
| `assert_ne`                 | assert not equal                                                                           |
| `assert`                    | assert                                                                                     |
| `bench`                     | Benchmark function                                                                         |
| `benches`                   | Benchmark group                                                                            |
